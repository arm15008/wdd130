    <h2>Justin Armstrong</h2>
    <h2>J Bills</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Justin Armstrong. I’m from Mesa, Arizona but about 5 years ago I moved to Utah with my family and I currently live in Vineyard, Utah which is just West of Orem.<br>
        I’m currently employed as an embedded systems software engineer at a great local company. I'm majoring in Applied Technology and the goal is to pursue a masters after completing my current path.<br> I am in constant pursuit of balance in family, work and school life with the busy schedule it all results in.  </p>
    <p>My favorite thing in the world is to be out enjoying nature with my wife and sons. I am an Arizona Diamondbacks baseball fan and will miss going to the games with my boys.<br>I'm also an Arizona State Sun Devils football fan and I’m looking forward to the season.<br>
        I was reminded of one of my favorite scriptures this easter - 2nd Nephi 25:26 “And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies,<br> that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.”</p>
