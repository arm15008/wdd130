      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I bake and sell baked goods 
        I contribute a percentage of my sells to a charitable foundation
        My company specifically makes all gluten free baked goods for a cause.
        My website provides a menu and order form for baked goods. 
        Do you or anyone you know suffer from celiac or any other type of autoimmune disease? We bake delicious, gluten free treats and give a percentage of our profits to the celiac foundation and other foundations for auto immune disease research.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Overall drive to visit our site
        Visitors will come to my site as opposed to others for the specific needs of their Celiac safe baked goods. There are other gluten free options out there when it comes to baked goods, but freshly baked to order gluten free cakes, doughnuts and other Celiac safe desserts are generally few and far between.  We hope to gain returning customers and loyalty through our delicious bakery items and the Celiac Disease Foundation. Our Bakery is named after my wife Morgan who suffers from Celiac herself. Her vision is to create a place of support and delicious baked goods for both those who suffer from Celiac and those who don’t. We hope to change minds about gluten free in general and the idea that gluten free items must be less flavorful than gluten alternatives.

      <h3>Home page / Menu</h3>
      <p>
        Gluten free bakery / menu
        I would hope that the primary reason people come to our website is to order our baked goods with confidence that those with Celiac disease will enjoy them. A few of the questions I can think of that our website would answer would be first what makes your baked goods totally safe for those with Celiac disease? The next question would be what categories of baked goods do we serve?
        To start, we have a completely gluten free supply line, our flour and all ingredients will be sourced free of gluten contaminates. The highest standards of cleanliness will be carried out to ensure no cross contaminates are ever present in our kitchen. We want to be a dependable and safe source of baked goods for those who suffer from Celiac disease. 
        As far as categories of baked goods, aside from seasonal items, we will consistently carry an assortment of cakes, doughnuts, and cookies. Our seasonal items will include cinnamon rolls, bread, pizza dough and more.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Ordering]</h3>
      <p>
        Ordering
        The information needed to complete actions on my site will consist of information for placing an order. It will include the customers email and phone number, the date and time of the pickup. 
We will have an order form and allow customers to write their order in a provided format for example “strawberry shortcake x 3” for ordering three of our strawberry shortcakes. 
We will also accept an order time as long as it is not within 2 hours of ordering. Larger orders (orders over 20 items or event catering) will receive a phone call with a pickup time scheduled. 
Our bakery will have a few of our nonseasonal items available for purchase in store, but all other purchases will be made fresh by order in store or online. Our website will not take payments, but upon reviewing your order we will place a phone call to take payment over the phone.

      </ul>
      <h3>[The Cause]</h3>
      <p>
        Support of Celiac foundation and Celiac research
Another question would be regarding how we contribute to the cause to help those with Celiac disease. We will commit to donating 15% of our profits to the Celiac Disease Foundation.  This foundation was formed in 1990 and seeks to fund medical research, education, and policy regarding Celiac Disease. We seek to become an ongoing donor to this foundation and it’s work to fund research that increases treatment options and diagnostic abilities. We also hope to join with them in supporting the cause to educate about Celiac Disease and increase public policy to benefit those who suffer from it. 
As we donate 15% of our profits we also are open to donations to benefit both the bakery as well as the Disease Foundation to keep this great cause moving forward.
